# Android Emulator Container Scripts

This is a set of minimal scripts to run the emulator in a container for various
systems such as Docker, for external consumption. The scripts are compatible with
both Python version 2 and 3.

# Requirements

These demos are intended to be run on a linux OS. Your system must meet the following
requirements:

- A Python interpreter must be installed.
- ADB must be available on the path. ADB comes as part of the [Android SDK](http://www.androiddocs.com/sdk/installing/index.html). Note that installing the command line tools is sufficient.
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/) must be installed.
- [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) must be installed.
- KVM must be available. You can get access to KVM by running on "bare metal", or on a (virtual) machine that provides [nested virtualization](https://blog.turbonomic.com/blog/). If you are planning to run this in the cloud (gce/azure/aws/etc..) you first must make sure you have access to KVM. Details on how to get access to KVM on the various cloud providers can be found here:

    - AWS provides [bare metal](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/02/introducing-five-new-amazon-ec2-bare-metal-instances/) instances that provide access to KVM.
    - Azure: Follow these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/nested-virtualization) to enable nested virtualization.
    - GCE: Follow these [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/enable-nested-virtualization-vm-instances) to enable nested virtualization.


# Install

The following Python libraries are required:

    urlfetch
    jinja2

They can be installed via `pip install urlfetch; pip install jinja2` (or use your favorite method).

# Docker

We have two scripts that work together to provide emulator docker images:

    emu_docker.py
    emu_download_menu.py

`emu_docker.py` sets up a Docker image source directory with a Dockerfile that is buildable and runnable as a Docker image, given a Linux emulator zip file, a system image zip file, and a docker repo name (currently unused; any name will do).

`emu_download_menu.py` lists a set of publically available Android Emulator system images and emulators along with their URLs, which makes it easier to download zip files for user with `emu_docker.py`.

## Obtaining URLs for emulator/system image zip files

Issuing:

    python emu_download_menu.py

will query the currently published Android SDK and output URLs for the zip files of:

- Available and currently Docker-compatible system images
- Currently published and advertised emulator binaries

For each system image, the API level, variant, ABI, and URL are displayed.  For
each emulator, the update channel (stable vs canary), version, host os, and URL
are displayed.

Example output:

One can then use tools like `wget` or a browser to download a desired emulator
and system image.  After the two are obtained, we can build a Docker image.

## Building the Docker image: Setting up the source dir

Given an emulator zip file and a system image zip file, we can build a
directory that can be sent to `docker build` via the following invocation of
`emu_docker.py`:

    python emu_docker.py <emulator-zip> <system-image-zip> <docker-repo-name(unused currently)> [docker-src-dir (getcwd()/src by default)]

This places all the right elements to run a docker image, but does not build,
run or publish yet. A Linux emulator zip file must be used.

To build the Docker image corresponding to these emulators and system images:

    docker build <docker-src-dir, either ./src or specified argument to emu_docker.py>

A Docker image ID will output; save this image ID.

## Running the Docker image

We currently assume that KVM will be used with docker in order to provide CPU
virtualization capabilties to the resulting Docker image.

We provide the following run script:

    ./run.sh <docker-image-id>

It does the following:

    docker run -e "ADBKEY=$(cat ~/.android/adbkey)" --privileged  --publish 5556:5556/tcp --publish 5555:5555/tcp <docker-image-id>


- Sets up the ADB key, assuming one exists at ~/.android/adbkey
- Uses `--privileged` to have CPU acceleration
- Starts the emulator in the docker image with its gRPC service, forwarding the host ports 5556/5554 to container ports 5554/5554 respectively.
- The gRPC service is used to communicate with the running emulator inside the container.

## Communicating with the emulator in the container

## adb

We forward the port 5555 for adb access to the emulator running inside the
container (TODO: make this configurable per container).

To enable ADB access, run the following adb command, assuming no other emulators/devices connected:

    adb connect localhost:5555

# Make the emulator accessible on the web

This repository also contains an example that demonstrates how you can use
docker to make the emulator accessible through the web. This is done by
composing the following set of docker containers:

- [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/), an edge and service proxy: The proxy is responsible for the following:
    - Offer TLS (https) using a self signed certificate
    - Redirect traffic on port 80 (http) to port 443 (https)
    - Act as a [gRPC proxy](https://grpc.io/blog/state-of-grpc-web/) for the emulator.
    - Redirect other requests to the Nginx component which hosts a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application.
- [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/), a webserver hosting a compiled React App
- The emulator with a gRPC endpoint and a WebRTC video bridge.

## Important Notice!

In order to run this sample and be able to interact with the emulator you must keep the following in mind:

- The demo has two methods to display the emulator.
    1. Create an image every second, which is displayed in the browser. This approach will always work, but gives poor performance.
    2. Use [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) to display the state of the emulator in
       real time. This will only work if you are able to create a peer to peer connection
       to the server hosting the emulator. This is usually not a problem when your server
       is publicly visible, or if you are running the emulator on your own intranet.

- **There is no Authorization/Authentication:.** Anyone who can reach the website will be able to
  interact with the emulator. Which means they can control the emulator and run arbitrary code
  inside your emulator.

## Requirements

- You will need to install [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- You must have port 80 and 443 available. The docker containers will create an
  internal network and expose the http and https ports.
- You will need to create an emulator docker image, as described in the documentation above.

## Running the emulator on the web

Once you have taken care of the steps above you can create the containers as follows:

    docker-compose -f js/docker/docker-compose.yaml build

After building the containers, you can launch the emulator as follows

    docker-compose -f js/docker/docker-compose.yaml up

Point your browser to [localhost](http://localhost). You will likely get
a warning due to the usage of the self signed certifcate. Once you accept the
cert you should see the emulator in action
