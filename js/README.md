JavaScript WebRTC samples
=========================

This document describes the gRPC/WebRTC example. You can find instructions in [README](../README.MD) if you wis to run the web version. This document outlines the how you can extend or develop the web version further.

The web version relies on the following technologies;

- There is a Webserver hosting the HTML/JS, we are using [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) for development.
- We are using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) as our component framework.
- We use [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) as the [gRPC web proxy](https://grpc.io/blog/state-of-grpc-web/).
- You are running [containerized](../README.MD) version of the emulator.

For fast video over [WebRTC](www.webrtc.org):

- The udp ports required for WebRTC are open, or a turn service is configured.

### Do I need TURN?

The most important thing to is to figure out if you need a [Turn Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT). **You usually only need this if your server running the emulator is behind a firewall, and not publicly accessible.** Most of the time there is no need for a turn server.

If for example you are running the emulator in a private Google GCE project, you will need to make use of a turn server. You can take the following steps to enable turn:

1. Enable a turn service. There are many services you could use. A quick [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=webrtc+turn+server+cloud+providers) will provide a series of provides. If you are internal at google you could use the [GCE turn api](http://go/turnaas).
2. Launch the emulator with the `-turncfg` flag.

   This will inform the videobridge to execute the given command for every new incoming connection to obtain the JSON turn configuration that will be used.

    This command must do the following:

    - Produce a result on stdout.
    - Produce a result within 1000 ms.
    - Produce a valid [JSON RTCConfiguration object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCConfiguration).
    - That contain at least an "iceServers" array.
    - The exit value should be 0 on success

    For example:

    ```sh
    emulator -grpc 8554 -turncfg "curl -s -X POST https://networktraversal.googleapis.com/v1alpha/iceconfig?key=MySec"
    ```

You can create the docker container with the `--extra` flag to pass in the turn configuration. For example:

```sh
emu-docker create stable \
           "O google_apis_playstore x86" \
           --extra  \
           '-turncfg "curl -s -X POST https://networktraversal.googleapis.com/v1alpha/iceconfig?key=mykey"' \
           --metrics
```

Would use the given curl command to obtain the the json snippet.

*NOTE: If you do not obtain ice configuration through curl you might need to modify the docker template
to make sure you can obtain the proper turn configuration.8

# Internal Organization

This sample is based on ReactJS and provides the following set of components:

- Emulator: This component displays the emulator and will send mouse & keyboard events to it.
- LogcatView: A view that displays the current output of logcat. This currently relies on the material-ui theme.

Both components require the following properties to be set:

- `emulator`: This property must contain an `EmulatorControllerService` object.

Components that you will need to include:

- **EmulatorWebrtcView**: A view on the emulator that is using WebRTC. It will use the Jsep protocol over gRPC to establish the video streams. This is the preferred method to view the emulator, as it will provide the best experience.
- **EmulatorPngView**:  A view on the emulator that is generated by requesting a screenshot at a fixed interval. Beware that these screenshots can arrive out of order, so the user experience could be a little odd at times. *Note: This is very expensive, and is merely here to showcase how you could make an interactive UI using gRPC.*
- **EmulatorFallbackView**: A View that will use WebRTC if possible, and otherwise will revert to using the png view.
- **JsepProtocol**: An invisible component that takes care of the JSepProtocol.
- **EmulatorStatus**: An invisible componet that reads the emulator status endpoint, parsing the results into a JSON blob.
- **EmulatorControllerService**: A component that takes care of the gRPC interactions and will inject authentication headers when needed.
- **TokenAuthService**: An authentication service that provides a JWT token to the EmulatorControllerService.

You will likely need to modify `App.js` and `index.html` to suit your needs.

## As a Developer

As a developer you will make use of an envoy docker container and use node.js to serve the react app.  First you must
make sure you create a containerized version of the emulator as follows:

```sh
emu-docker create stable "Q google_apis_playstore x86"
```

This will binplace all the files needed for development under the src directory.
Next you can get the development environment ready by:


```sh
  $ make deps
```

And start envoy + nodejs as follows:

```
  $ make develop
```

This should open up a browser, and detect any change made to the webpages and JavaScript sources. Hit ctrl-c to stop the dev environment. Note that shutdown takes a bit as a docker container needs to shut down.

## Limitations

gRPC is not well supported in the browser and has only support for unary calls and server side streaming. This restricts support for other services
such as [Waterfall](https://github.com/google/devx-tools/tree/master/waterfall).
